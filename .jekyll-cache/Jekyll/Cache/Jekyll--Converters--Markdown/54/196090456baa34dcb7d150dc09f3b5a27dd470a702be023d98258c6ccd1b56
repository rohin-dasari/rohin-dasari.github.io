I"¨<p>So, I was working on a a simple javascript game this weekend and Iâ€™ve
implemented the core game mechanics, initial world generation, and user
interface to display the score, instructions, etc. Iâ€™m feeling pretty good
about it, but then I had the daunting task of building levels. This was seeming
like it would be the most time consuming part of the whole ordeal and it was
honestly starting to seem like a pain.</p>
