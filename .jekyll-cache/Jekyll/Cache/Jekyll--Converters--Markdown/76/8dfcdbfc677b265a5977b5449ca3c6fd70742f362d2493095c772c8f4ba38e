I"¿<p>CycleGAN is a type of General Adversarial Neural Network for image to image
translation. This involes taking images that belong to one domain and
translating them to another. Now what do I mean by domain? In this case, a
domain is a general category to which an image can belong. An example of a
domain could be a set of landscape photos that were taken in the summer time.
Another example of another domain could be set of landscape photos that were
taken in the winter time. CycleGAN would allow us to translate the images taken
in the summer to look as if they were taken in the winter. This is pretty
powerful and can have some pretty interesting applications, especially for
generative art.</p>
